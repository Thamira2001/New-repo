# **SUPERSET VISION STATEMENT** #

### Introduction ###
“Superset” is an Android application that will be used to help gym-goers track and visualize their activity  at the gym. It will keep records of the gym-goers’ specific workout information such as day of workout, workout time, exercises performed, and time performing each exercise. This information is then used to provide an easy to interpret visual representation of the gym-goers’ workout activity.

### Target audience ###
The system is primarily designed for use by individuals who work out (gym-goers). Gym-goers will be able to add and modify workouts, including workout dates, workout times, and exercises performed. They will also be able to view such workouts in multiple formats.

The system can also be used by personal trainers. These personal trainers will be able to add and modify workouts for their trainee, as well as view their trainee's workout history.

### Description of project ###
Gym-goers will be able to create workouts within the app and have the ability to note down specific information about their routines when at the gym. Gym-goers will also be able to keep track of the time spent performing specific activities, the time spent resting, and the total time spent in a gym session. Each gym session will be stored within the app. The app will provide workout history and a graph to visualize and understand workout routines and trends.

Superset will allow gym-goers to schedule workouts ahead of time. The app will also include goal setting tools to prompt and inform users of their exercise goals. The app will also remind gym-goers about the scheduled workout of the day and will congratulate them on reaching goals as positive reinforcement.

Superset will also have the option for users to upload progress pictures and their weight in order for them to track their progress better. Reminders will be sent at an interval specified by gym-goers. Furthermore, the app will combine their progress updates and their workout goal together quarterly throughout the year as a recollection of the user’s progress.

### Project value ###
The main purpose of the Superset app is to provide individuals a means to track their workout progress. This feature provides a significant amount of value to individuals who work out. Having a history of previous routines can serve as motivation for future workouts. Illustrating to the user their progress can act as a means for positive reinforcement. Workout history can also allow users to identify patterns in their workout routines (for example, not working out much in March) and consciously act upon them. With our application, it is easy to add workout routines so users don’t have to spend a significant amount of time tracking their routines and can designate more time to gym activities. Thus, Superset provides users with workout history, motivation, and time saving features to help people live more active and healthier lives.

Superset serves as a tracking and motivation application as opposed to a virtual personal trainer. As such, Superset does not provide guides to help beginners, workout recommendations, or anything else of that nature. This can provide value to many gym-goes who know what exercises they want to perform and don’t want to have to navigate around excess features (which are often present in many of today's workout applications).

### Success criteria ###
Superset will be considered successful if the majority of gym-goers that use it find the main feature (in-gym workout logging) useful during their workouts, determined by a survey. It will also be considered successful if users regularly reach 75% of their workout count goal, upload picture/weight updates, and interact with reminders. We can measure this feature by looking at user data.
