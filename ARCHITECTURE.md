We utilize a 3-tier architecture
Have Persistence, Buisiness and Presentation layer
Persistence holds data
Buisiness performs logic calculations
Presentation is responsible for UI components
Each of these layers is contained in its own package
We also have a package called objects for domain-specific objects
We included an image of our architecture in file "ARCHITECTURE.jpg"
