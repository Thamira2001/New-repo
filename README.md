# **README (GROUP 7)**

- FOR THIS ITERATION 
  - WE HAVE COMPLETED ONE FEATURE
  - UPLOAD PROGRESS 
    - BUT when we try to add it to the persistance layer we get an error that we don't have tie to fix
      - we created all the persistance abstraction layers(followed the agile process) and even updated the script file but we could not find the error due to the lack of time
    - so we have commented out the insertion of the update data so that app wont crash 
    - Furthermore, we were only left with three members for I3 because one person has not contributed or communicated with us for the whole project and one of our most active embers dropped the course 
    -
